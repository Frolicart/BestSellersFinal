        <h3 class="u-text u-text-1">Findings</h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">Before the 2000's there were 9 games that made the list, Nintendo had 7 games out of 9 that made the list. Namco and Sonic Team were the other 2 companies that followed them up in the years before. Where it does say "Game Freak" as a developer is also considered to be under Nintendo because "Pokemon" is a game title owned by Nintendo.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>In 2006, the most common year on the list, Nintendo also dominated that year as well. With titles like Wii Sports, Wii Play, Pokemon Pearl/Diamond and New Super Mario Bros., they had a dominant year with 4 out of 5 games being top sellers during this year. The only other company to have had a top seller this year was Electronic Arts Mobile with their release of Tetris (which has the 3rd top spot on the list.)<br>
          <br>Based on the 2 questions proposed, I came to the conclusion that Nintendo not only had multiple high selling games released within one year, but they also dominated before the 2000's with their classic releases that remain on the top sellers list to this day.&nbsp;

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>This lesson on data is more or less finding patterns and being able to find correlations in combined or singular data sets. The information provided is useful to beginners in data analysis as it helps provide insight into looking for patterns. I more or less skimmed through the learning portion of th​e articles and moved onto testing where the questions seemed complicated but provided enough context for me to easily analyze the data and find the answer relatively quickly. Being an introduction to data tools, this is an excellent refresher on how to spot patterns.&nbsp;</b>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>With the introduction of Big Data into our society we needed better ways and faster ways to process said data. To see how big and expansive all of our data has gotten is fascinating and even more so when you see how much our storage capabilities have condensed down. The concepts here in this module aren’t foreign to me, but I would love to dive further into this section of learning to get a more hands on approach. Parallel computing interests me the most and it seems so complicated on the surface but it likely is as easy as installing software and connecting certain components with one another to help break up the data.</b>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>I have a background in machine learning bias, and that pertains to the field of art and its sub-categories. To see how machine learning affects not only the art world in a vast majority of ways, but also the criminal justice system is astonishing. Heavy reliance on these new algorithms can result in very skewed results and actions taken by those acting on said data sets. That said, a larger and more public data set can help to improve MLAs overall but with a greater deal of human intervention at the ready.</b>

I had trouble with some of the big data portions of the test, but when it came to the pattern recognition and machine learning bias spotting, it was a lot easier for me to breeze through those questions. Logical thinking is very much required when taking this test and it is a topic I will be visiting at Khan Academy in my spare time.&nbsp;</b>
